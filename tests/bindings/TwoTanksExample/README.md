This is the code for the Two Tank example we will be using in the project.
It depends on the VVDR library, to load it in OMEdit:
	File > System Libraries > VVDRLib
To load the example, load the package.mo in the root folder TwoTanksExample. It should load everything.
To run the complete verification model go to 
	UserDefinedVerificationModels package and simulate GraphicalModel.mo

Notes:
	- set a longer simulation time, the default is 1
	- try plotting the different variable 
	(e.g.: volume of liquid in the tank, status of requirements)
