Find here some user defined language files for Notepad++.

file             | description
---------------- | -----------
Modelica.xml     | This file contains basic syntax highlighting for Modelica, as well as OpenModelica.Scripting. It has been downloaded from the MA website.
crml.xml         | This file contains basic syntax highlighting for crml. It has been developed on purpose for the EMBrACE project.
			           

These files are quite easy to install in Notepad++ to set up some appropriate syntax highlighting. 
Just click "Language" -> "Define your Language..." -> "Import...".
Thatâ€™s it!

If "Import" is not working, try to:
- create a "userDefineLangs" folder in your local directory:
	...\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs
- put the .xml files in that folder
